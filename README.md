This repository serves as an archive of darknet market information, including:

- Vendor lists
- Vendor PGP keys
- Listings and descriptions
- Market structure and other relevant data

## CDN

If you're looking to download **"The Darknet Market Archives"** from Gwern.net but find the available options (rsync and torrent) too slow, you can download it directly from my CDN:

ðŸ”— **[DarkWebInformer CDN](https://darkwebinformer.io)**

This provides a faster and more reliable alternative to Gwernâ€™s options.

## Purpose

This project aims to preserve darknet market data for research, intelligence gathering, and historical reference. All data is collected from open sources and is intended for informational purposes only.
